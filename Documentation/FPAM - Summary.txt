Football Performance Analytics Model -



// What do we want to accomplish? 

We want a data-driven way to estimate which team has a higher probability of winning an upcoming match, using historical performance.

So the question is: Can we quantify team strength and recent form to estimate match outcome probability?


How are we going to estimate those probabilities?? Using this metrics: 

-Recent performance ( WE ARE GOING TO FOCUS ONLY ON THE LAST 5 MATCHES
-Goals scored vs goals received 
-Home vs Away performance 
-Head-to-head history 
-Win streak momentum
-League position 

// What is going to be our deliverable??

THE BIG PICTURE : 

For any match: 

Team A vs Team B - > 

-Team A strength score
-Team B strength score
-Estimated win probability %
-Confidence indicator


DATA TERMS : 

-Win rate ( 5 LAST GAMES )
-Avg scored goals ( LAST 5 GAMES )
-Avg scored conceded ( LAST 5 GAMES )
-Goal difference rolling AVG ( ? )
-Points per match
-Home advantage factor ( ? ) 

Match-Level Context
-Is team A playing home?
-Head-to-head win %  ( ? )
-Current season performance

"The objective of my project was to build a data-driven model that estimates the probability of each team winning an upcoming football match 
based on historical performance over the last 5 matches, recent form, and contextual match factors."

DATA REQUIREMENTS : 

// 1- RECENT FORM (MOMENTUM)
-Win rate last 5 matches
-Goal difference last 5 matches
-Points per match

Why - Teams in good form win more matches


// 2- OFFENSIVE STRENGTH
-Avg goals scored
-Shots on target ( IF THE API HAS THAT DATA AVAILABLE ) 
-Expected goals ( IF THE API HAS THAT DATA AVAILABLE )

Why - Teams that score more win more

// 3- DEFENSIVE STRENGTH
-Avg goals conceded
-Clean sheet rate (?)

Why - Strong defense increases win probability 


// 4- HOME ADVANTAGE
-Win rate at home
-Win rate away 

Why - Home teams statistically win more

// 5- HEAD-TO-HEAD (?)
-Last 3-5 matches
-Historical win %

why - Some matchups historically favor one team.



CORE METRICS! ( LAST 5 MATCHES )

// 1 - RECENT WIN RATE ( RWR ) 

RWR = WINS LAST 5 / 5


// 2 - RECENT GOAL DIFFERENCE AVERAGE ( RGD ) 

RGA = AVG(GOALS_SCORED - GOALS_CONCEDED) LAST_5_MATCHES


// 3 - RECENT POINTS PER MATCH ( RPM )

Standard football scoring: 

Win = 3
Draw = 1
Loss = 0 

RPM = POINTS_LAST_5 / 5


// 4 - HOME ADVANTAGE FACTOR ( HAF )

If team is playing at home:

HAF = HOME_WIN_RATE_SEASON - AWAY_WIN_RATE_SEASON 



Step 1 - Calculate Strength Score For Each Team ( 5 previous matches )


OK .. Then : How to calculate the TEAM_STRENGTH ?

TEAM_STRENGTH = (RWR) + (RGD) + (RPM) + (HAF)

Team A Strength = S_A
Team B Strength = S_B



Step 2 - Compute Strength Difference

DIFF = S_A - S_B

Diff > 0 → Home stronger
Diff < 0 → Away stronger
Diff ≈ 0 → Balanced → Higher draw probability
